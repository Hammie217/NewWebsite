      <h1 class="section">CLUEA</h1>
    <p class="bodyText">
        On top of most knowledge management texts referring to tacit and explicit knowledge explaining what can be shared I believe there is also two ways to gain knowledge, through research (New knowledge) or sharing of knowledge (Old Knowledge) (I would like to add that magically I defined this almost identically to Hayes, M.; Walsham, G. (2003). "Knowledge sharing and ICTs: A relational perspective”). Knowledge management typically consists of the sharing of explicit knowledge but I don’t doubt knowledge management could also stretch to all other kinds too especially with the aid of technology.
        <br />
        As a starting point for determining a good knowledge management system it would seem logical to realise all of the different methods we can share knowledge and perhaps the most successful of these in everyday modern life. (I am not covering specialist items here such a Braille but these may need to be thought about for certain applications although most options mentioned have well determined alternatives for those of special needs.).</p>
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Audio Books</li>
    <li>Blog posts</li>
    <li>Educational Game</li>
    <li>Forums/Threads/Documented Discussions</li> 
    <li>In person problem solving exercise </li>
    <li>Manuals</li>
    <li>Meeting/Presentation</li>

    <li>Symposium</li>
    <li>Tutorial (In person interactive )</li>
    <li>Video Series</li>
    <li>Video</li>
</ul>

<p class="bodyText">
This is by no means an exhaustive list but still many options to be considered.
Some very successful knowledge managers
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Google</li>
    <li>YouTube</li>
    <li>Audible</li>
    <li>HBR</li>
    <li>Linkedin Learning</li>
    <li>Chetham’s Library</li>
</ul>

<p class="bodyText">
Despite these all offering different types of information there are a lot of similarities between them. What makes these stand out from the many information sources in the world is one main factor. The availability of high quality information, every single one of these knowledge managers makes it as easy as possible to find the knowledge someone wants by having an effective system for finding the information without being overcrowded. 
<br />
Some useful knowledge method metrics
<br />
Each application has a different set of requirements for what your knowledge management needs to meet. To help choose the correct medium you may want to review some key metrics here called CLUEA to help with defining the problem. In your specific application you should rank each of these CLUEA metrics from 0-10 and create a decision matrix with the methods to define the most useful for your application.
<br />
The CLUEA metrics are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Creation - How easy is it to make the knowledge item.</li>
    <li>Length - How long does the knowledge item take to understand and learn from.</li>
    <li>Understanding - How in depth of an understanding of the knowledge item give.</li>
    <li>Enjoyment - How enjoyable and interactive is the knowledge item.</li>
    <li>Access - How easy is it to have access to the knowledge item.</li>
</ul>

<p class="bodyText">
Useful tools for creating a knowledge management system: <br />
A knowledge graph / structure to segment knowledge reducing the overcrowding of knowledge in one area. This will need to be very specific and clear to ensure the storage and location of information location is clear. This requires a good amount of time being put into determining a structure or defining an agile approach to the structure over the systems life. Not only splitting knowledge down by department but also by type of information such as in engineering: manuals vs ways of working vs system designs. 
</p>


<h1 class="section">Evaluation (TLDR)</h1>
<p class="bodyText">
Overall when designing a modern knowledge management system is is important to develop a system capable of delivering high quality information as available as possible. To aid in this, first designing a knowledge hierarchy is key not only allowing the ability to find searched knowledge but also for others to discover new sources and regions of interest. When determining a knowledge management system it should be capable of storing all types of information appropriate for the application (See the CLUEA matrix).
<br />
Instead, when designing or reviewing what medium best suits your knowledge wanting to be stored you should use the CLUEA methodology alongside the aforementioned matrix to help decide the most appropriate method of storage.
