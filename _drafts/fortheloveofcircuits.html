<h1 class="section">About</h1>
    <p class="bodyText">
        When working on projects common building blocks are used constantly. Finding simple and reliable information around these circuits can be hard and deriving them each time is a pain. To get around this I recently bought the domain <a href="https://fortheloveofcircuits.co.uk/">fortheloveofcircuits.co.uk</a> and i'm now trying to make a simple log of common circuits perfect for a quick lookup when designing and for a barebones explanation of how the circuits work.

<h1 class="section">Getting involved</h1>
    <p class="bodyText">
        The website is open source with the code being found on <a href="https://github.com/Hammie217/forTheLoveOfCircuits">GitHub</a>. If you would like to help offer circuit ideas, create circuit diagrams, derive transfer functions or descriptions please do. Feel free to create a pull request for any additions, issues for any ideas or contact me to chat about any of it.
