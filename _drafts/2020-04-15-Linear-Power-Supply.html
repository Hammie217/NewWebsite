description : After struggling for power for all project for years, constantly relying on bodging other power supplies, I decided to invest some time to create a small, precision variable power supply.

<h1 class="section">Introduction</h1>
    <p class="bodyText">
        If you haven't seen the previous design post <a href="https://hamish.science/2020/04/15/linear-power-supply">here</a>, feel free to take a look at the design stage first. Here I will discuss the building up process, what I learned, debugging and desired improvements for the project.
        Overall the Version 1 board was successful, a few issues I wouldn't like to ship a product with (See Figure: 1) but all of which are a learning dimension.

    <ul class="bodyText">
        <li>Sense- not connected</li>
        <li>Capacitors C2,C3 and C4 too low voltage (Bang)</li>
        <li>Q1 Pin 2-3 shorted</li>
        <li>Max4080 output oscillating (filter or re-design)</li>
        <li>Display MISO need to be connected to a new RS pin</li>
        <li>LT3080 Heatplane re-design</li>
        <li>Max4080 no decoupling</li>
        <li>Grounding method improvements</li>
        <li>Display header doesn't fit without extension (would be wired in box)</li>
        <li>Rotary encoders too close</li>
        <li>Contacts too small for banana plugs</li>
        <li>Footprints aren't good for handsoldering</li>
        <li>Crystal oscillator minutely too small</li>
        <li>Crystal oscillator not needed but could be improved</li>
        <li>Overcurrent detection transistor</li>
        <li>Rotary encoders not notched</li>
        <li>Another diagnostic LED (good for showing current limit)</li>
        <li>Shrink the board and tighten component placement based around a project case</li>
        <li>Logo to silk screen</li>
        <li>Re-design input power stage? (Not sure yet, no resources to test mains safely)</li>

      </ul>
