<h1 class="section">Introduction</h1>
<p class="bodyText">
    When making circuit I am constantly using resistors matched by some ratio in some form or another, whether that be in an op-amp multiplier or a simple resisistive divider. 
When you have strange ratios such 5.95 I required for the LM399 testbench it can be hard to find standard values with a common ratio.
There are online tools to tell you the best mixture of standard resistors to create a required resistance but none that I could find that will find a ratio or use a single resistor.
This is much more use for me as I would much rather use a single resistor in my design than over-complicate a design with series and parallel combinations and I am almost always looking for ratios not specific resistances. 
To do this I have made an installable console command that will allow you to find the best ratio.
You can get it from GitHub <a href="https://github.com/Hammie217/resistorSelectorC">Here</a> and install simply by:
</p>
<pre class="language-bash blogCodeblock">
    ./configure 
    make 
    make install 
</pre>


<h1 class="section">What it does</h1>
<p class="bodyText">
ResRat is a simple interface allowing for input of a ratio which compares all common resistor series to see if there is a resistor ratio that matches and if not reports back the closest in each series as seen below.

<h1 class="subsection">Command line arguments</h1>
<p class="bodyText">
    ResRat has two command line arguments if you'd like to skip the input step for speed and instead pass it in the command or choose a specific resistor series.
    </p>
<pre class="language-bash blogCodeblock">
    resrat -r *resistor ratio* -e *resistor series*
</pre>
