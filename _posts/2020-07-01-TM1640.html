            When designing circuits it's always a pain when your supplier or CAD software doesn't have a symbol for your component you can use.
            In most pieces of software creating these isn't going to take you hours but it is certainly laborious and mundane.
            The TM1640 is no different given the 28 pins and odd sized package.
            I needed this IC for my display board V1 found <a href="https://hamish.science/2020/06/30/bigdisplay">here</a>, and thought i'd put others out of the misery of following in my footsteps.

            The KiCAD symbol is created in a functional design with inputs on the left and outputs on the right as seen below.
